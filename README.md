#Brief

As I slowly continue studying artificial intelligence, I often catch myself
wondering if it is possible to train a neural network to predict market prices.
Plan is to only use limited price history and maybe some indicators. There are
huge amounts of data freely available on the internet to train the network, so
that's convenient. Also, this will probably be written in JavaScript using the
p5.js library and either TensorFlow.js or ml5 libraries.

Note that this project might not be finished. Ever. It's just something I have
wanted to try for a while now.
